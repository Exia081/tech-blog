---

Hey there! I'm **Exia Huang** ðŸ‘‹ - a software engineer who's totally obsessed with technology and loves learning new stuff. Right now, I'm working in the smart hardware industry, building cloud services that make cool gadgets work behind the scenes.

## What Gets Me Excited

I'm a software engineer who's really into:

- **Backend Development**: Building systems that can grow and evolve over time (like a digital LEGO set that keeps getting bigger!)
- **Making Things Reliable**: Creating solutions that keep websites running smoothly, even when things go wrong
- **Business Analysis**: I love digging deep into how businesses work, finding the pain points, and figuring out how people, processes, systems, and business goals all fit together. It's like being a detective, but for companies!
- **Sharing Knowledge**: I read a lot of books and learn from my work experiences, so I share what I discover. It helps me grow, and hopefully helps others too!

## My Story So Far

Here's how I got here:

- **2011**: Started studying software engineering in Guangzhou. My first programming language was C - pretty old school, right? I was doing low-level network programming (the kind that makes the internet work).
- **Internship Days**: Built a hospital logistics warehouse management system. I worked on everything - device apps, web apps, and backend services. The coolest part? It got deployed in 8 hospitals! That was the first time I realized my code could actually help people in real life. Pretty awesome feeling!
- **Post-Graduation**: I've worked in different industries - internet, education, and now smart hardware. Each one taught me something different.
- **Experience**: Spent about 5 years at smaller companies managing backend cloud services, and another 5 years at bigger companies working on company-wide backend systems. Both experiences were incredible and taught me so much!

## What I'll Share Here

I'll be posting regularly about these topics:

- **Tech Thoughts**: Deep dives into programming concepts, best practices, and the lessons I've learned (sometimes the hard way!)
- **Culture & Industry**: My thoughts on tech culture, industry trends, and how to grow in your career
- **Life Stuff**: Just regular thoughts about life from someone who happens to be a software engineer
